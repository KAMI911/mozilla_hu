UIs are a bit like fashion - sometimes you change the way your clothes looks,

8
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,767
even though the clothes isn't broken.

9
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:24,500
Sometimes you need a new fresh look on something.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,533
Aesthetics change and we learn lessons over time

11
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,100
and we have to correct our mistakes from the past.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,100
I'm really excited to talk to the world about these changes.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,642
Our users have changed, their behaviors have changed,

14
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,633
competitors have changed, the way people use the Web,

15
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:41,527
the Web has changed, right?

16
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:45,932
Those little things, the little refinements that just

17
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:49,511
take something from a good idea to - you know. <i>woosh</i>

18
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,610
Beautiful.

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,987
I mean, we already hear about people who click that bookmark

20
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,300
and then unbookmark and bookmark again, just to see it go,

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,833
right? And that's what you want, you want these little

22
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,033
delightful moments.

23
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,433
Biggest under-the-hood change was the way we do customization.

24
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,568
If you remove all of the buttons out of the menu panel,

25
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:09,068
now we show a bouncing unicorn.

26
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:13,867
Tabs! You wouldn't think it would be such an impassioned topic,

27
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,337
but it is.

28
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:17,440
No, there's been no physical violence.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,200
Those tabs are, like, buttery smooth now.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,768
Why curvy tabs?

31
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,410
We've gone from kind of the square tabs

32
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,100
and we wanted something more aerodynamic.

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,333
They're smooth as silk.That's something I'm particularly proud of.

34
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,533
We put a lot of work into making them look aerodynamic,

35
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,100
so they actually appear faster, but we also put a lot of work on

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,034
the technical side, to make them actually be faster.

37
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:40,167
Madhava with a tab strapped to his head to prove that our tabs

38
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:44,267
are 20% more streamlined than the competition.

39
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:47,200
With the air flowing over it in a wind tunnel.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,467
It was surprisingly hard.

41
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,668
Our engineers are just amazing, they're magicians and they

42
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,033
can make anything happen.

43
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:57,724
This is the biggest change that I've seen in Firefox in its history.
