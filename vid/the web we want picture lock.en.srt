1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,864
THE WEB WE WANT

2
00:00:00,864 --> 00:00:03,388
THE WEB WE WANT
an open letter

3
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:07,406
I am not a data point

4
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:09,503
to be bought and sold.

5
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:11,925
I am not a threat.

6
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:15,270
Why are my baby pictures under surveillance?

7
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:18,408
My identity is mine.

8
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:19,929
You don’t own it.

9
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,161
I am a citizen.

10
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,263
Who lives in the world

11
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:24,180
and on the web.

12
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:25,633
I need rights.

13
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:27,833
Rights I can understand.

14
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:30,234
I need technology I can trust

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,889
from people who respect me.

16
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,382
I'm grateful for what you've given the world

17
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:39,233
and scared of how powerful you've become.

18
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:41,690
Remember to put me first!

19
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,390
Balance commercial profit

20
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,850
and public benefit.

21
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:47,602
Keep the web free and open.

22
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:49,685
Give me the tools I need

23
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:51,854
to build the future I dream.

24
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:55,554
The internet is our largest shared resource.

25
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:57,343
Let’s take care of it.

26
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,062
There has never been a better time.
