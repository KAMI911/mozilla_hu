00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,022
What is Mozilla?

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:05,022
Let me try to answer this

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:07,047
Mozilla is a collection of people

4
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:11,098
Mozilla is a global project,

5
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:13,070
it's a non-profit organization

6
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,033
it is this incredible movement of

7
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:18,077
really, really passionate people

8
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:22,015
I think it attracts people who are interested in helping others

9
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:24,043
and who want to work with a group to do something important

10
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:26,050
(laughs) crazy people

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,078
Mozilla is of course best known for our product Firefox

12
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:35,039
The Firefox project was born in a time

13
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,053
when the Web became stagnant

14
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:38,096
and the only browser out there

15
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:40,047
was Internet Explorer

16
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:41,096
It's one thing to talk about competition

17
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:44,062
as sort of an idealized economic good

18
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:45,078
it's another thing to say

19
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,032
"your browser made my life so much better

20
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:51,076
my computer was so slow and I was getting pop ups and couldn't use it"

21
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:52,095
I thought the Internet was terrible

22
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,099
and now its all better

23
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:55,028
and this is what happened in 2004

24
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:56,051
when we launched Firefox

25
00:00:58,027 --> 00:00:59,046
There is a lot of innovation

26
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:01,003
we drove in the browser

27
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,083
which you found today across all browsers

28
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,040
A lot of the good things that we built

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,057
have come from people who

30
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:08,034
don't happen to work on the project full time

31
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,078
and that's a really important thing

32
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,074
Innovation doesn't happen unless people are tinkering

33
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,090
and tinkering doesn't happen

34
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,086
unless they have access to the code

35
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,024
You end up with a much richer ecosystem

36
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:21,045
when you have more people

37
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,082
trying out their ideas

38
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,027
and seeing what works

39
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:25,075
and sometimes that translates back into us

40
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,022
and we say "that's a good idea

41
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:27,087
we would like to use it

42
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,024
and we're going to ship it to everybody"

43
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,019
Mozilla is a very important experiment

44
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:32,029
because we operate like

45
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:33,029
a for profit company

46
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:34,073
we have a high quality product

47
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:35,077
we have customers

48
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:37,037
and instead of shareholders

49
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:38,049
who want profit

50
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,083
we have a mission

51
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,023
to keep the web open

52
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:42,043
to provide choice

53
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:43,087
that's why we're a non-profit

54
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,024
is so we can make our product decisions

55
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,023
based on user experience

56
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:50,031
and empowering people

57
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,058
and building a product that cares

58
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:53,075
that you're a citizen and a human being

59
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:55,041
and not based on

60
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,084
that you own a wallet

61
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:09,003
we are for

62
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,038
an independent

63
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,050
and open Internet

64
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,043
If Mozilla or other organizations weren't fighting

65
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:17,016
for these things

66
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:21,021
The web would become like other mass media

67
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:24,007
That is, dominated by a few

68
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,038
The definition of open source implies

69
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:32,042
working together without discrimination

70
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,079
The web isn't just something that you consume

71
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,059
it's something you can actually affect yourself

72
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,008
We have these ideas about how the world should work

73
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,062
and we tend to embody that in

74
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,089
something that individual people can touch

75
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,040
and be part of

76
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,003
and that's different
