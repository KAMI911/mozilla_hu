1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,013
In the beginning the web was simple, connected

2
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:07,047
open, safe

3
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:09,030
designed as a force for good

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,047
it would become something far greater

5
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:13,067
a living, breathing ecosystem

6
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,068
in service of humanity

7
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:17,074
a public resource for innovation

8
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:19,021
and opportunity.

9
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,075
A place to build your dreams.

10
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:23,024
But in those early days,

11
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,069
like any ecosystem,

12
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:26,005
the web needed nurturing.

13
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,082
As it grew, users faced new challenges.

14
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:32,093
Popups. Viruses.

15
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:34,086
A lack of choice.

16
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:37,037
Walled gardens of content.

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,093
The web was fraying.

18
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:42,057
it was slow, complicated, scary.

19
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:44,037
Users began to ask...

20
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:46,001
is this it?

21
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,094
or could the web be something better?

22
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:50,035
A small group of people

23
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:52,068
coders, designers, idealists

24
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:54,065
believed it could.

25
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:56,062
They had an audacious idea.

26
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:59,049
That a tiny non-profit and a global community

27
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,032
could build something better

28
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:05,016
and force new ideas and innovation on to the Web.

29
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:08,040
They called it the Mozilla project.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,013
They began by making a new kind of Web browser.

31
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:14,030
What we know today as Firefox.

32
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,094
And they made it a non-profit,

33
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:20,031
so it would always put the people who use the web first.

34
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:22,065
more than software, it was a platform that

35
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:26,058
anyone could use to build on their ideas.

36
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,018
The nuisances diminished.

37
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:30,022
The foundations of the Web we know today

38
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,049
began to appear

39
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,059
Now the Web is a place where you can build almost

40
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:37,026
anything you can imagine

41
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:38,086
Mozilla and Firefox

42
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:42,026
exist to help people everywhere seize this opportunity

43
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:46,040
and to stand up for users in a world where choice and control

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,057
are too often at risk.

45
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:52,068
But what if Firefox was just the beginning?

46
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:55,095
What if it was part of something bigger?

47
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:58,045
From user privacy to Firefox Mobile,

48
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,038
to apps and identity,

49
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:03,045
we're pushing the boundaries of the web every day.

50
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:06,002
And we are going beyond software.

51
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:09,086
We're helping to build a generation of web makers.

52
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,086
we believe the web is a place where anyone

53
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:15,013
can come to build their dreams.

54
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:17,023
It's why we make Firefox.

55
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:21,027
It's why tens of thousands of volunteers help build our products.

56
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:24,091
It's why hundreds of millions around the world use our software

57
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:28,088
But most importantly -- it's why we always put you first,

58
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:31,061
and stand up to those who don't.

59
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:34,045
millions know us for Mozilla Firefox.

60
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:36,098
But we are about so much more.

61
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:39,006
We are a non-profit

62
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,033
fighting to protect the web we all love.

63
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:45,016
