99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Ok, all righty

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are really excited about this new version of Firefox

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'd like to show you why.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Hi, my name is Jonathan Nightingale, I'm the Vice President of Firefox here at Mozilla

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is our biggest update in a while and you are gonna see it right away

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but the changes go more than skin deep

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are a lot of improvements under the hood, that I'd like to talk to you about as well

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The new Firefox menu combines all of the command functions that you're gonna need from Firefox into a single place

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and gets out of your way when you don't need it.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can even create bookmarks with a single click and manage them from the same place.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The redesign of Firefox tabs makes it more beautiful, yes, but also means that the tabs you are not looking at disappear into the background

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so they don't act at some much of a distraction

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
With the new Firefox menu in customization mode, it's easier than ever to make Firefox your own

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can remove buttons you don't use, you can reorganize things to make it more natural to you

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Not just in the toolbar, but in the menu as well

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if there's functions that you need quick access too, you can bring them up

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you print a lot of documents for example, put it on the toolbar so you don't have to go hunting in menus

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This also works with the thousand of Firefox add-ons out there.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you want the "Send a Kindle" add-on or a Pinterest add-on as part of your menu

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can drag and drop it, just like any other part of Firefox

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Part of making Firefox your own also means being able to take it with you

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's why we've made it so easy to set-up Firefox Sync

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can nick your bookmarks, history, passwords

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can access them from any device just by creating an account

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and let Firefox take care of the rest.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And as with all things that we do, your information will be kept secure

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Mozilla is a mission-driven organization, dedicated to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the Web

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's why we build Firefox around the idea of protecting your privacy

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's why we are the most trusted company on the Internet

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are really excited about the new release of Firefox and we built it for you

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So give it a try, and thanks for watching.
